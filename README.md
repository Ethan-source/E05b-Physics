The purpose of this exercise was to explore how gravity and collisions are written in python arcade. Throughout this assignment, I have had figure out to apply the fundamentals of gravity to a group of balls to make them behave as you would expect. In order to complete this assignment I had to use intuition and my knowledge of the laws of gravity to write code/input values that would allow the code to work.
